## About

This is a tool for tweaking the projection parameters for Mike Bostock's [Satellite Projection](bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3790444). Built on top of energy.gov's jekyll platform (loosely). It should work in browser and in the future you should be able to print (to the clipboard) the parameters you have selected.

A work in progress. Please feel free to contribute/fork. It is public domain, as a result of it being part of my work with the [Energy Department](https://github.com/energyapps). See also [Energy.gov/maps](https://energy.gov/maps)

## Wish/To-do List
- don't redraw but just select (improve d3 selection)
- on enter, fire the reload
- add color changing options
- add option to print (onto the clipboard?) your results
- sliders for values
- weighted random for tilt, distance, etc. 
- correct random intervals for yaw, pitch, and roll.
- Potentially include [Tangle JS](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) into the parametersm (instead of sliders?)
