## About

[See the Tool here](http://danieljwood.github.io/d3-satellite-tool/)

This is a tool for tweaking the projection parameters for Mike Bostock's [Satellite Projection](bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3790444). Built on top of energy.gov's jekyll platform (loosely). It should work in browser and in the future you should be able to print (to the clipboard) the parameters you have selected.

A work in progress. Please feel free to contribute/fork. It is public domain, as a result of it being part of my work with the [Energy Department](https://github.com/energyapps). See also [Energy.gov/maps](https://energy.gov/maps)

## Wish/To-do List
- Allow yaw, pitch, and roll to change on drag of mouse!!!
- on enter, fire the reload
- fix the update/transition of graticules and land shapes
- add option to print parameters (onto the clipboard?)
- sliders for values (or +/- buttons)
- weighted random for tilt, distance, etc. 
- correct random intervals for yaw, pitch, and roll.
- Potentially include [Tangle JS](http://worrydream.com/Tangle/) into the parametersm (instead of sliders?)
