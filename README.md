## About

This is a tool for tweaking the projection parameters for Mike Bostock's Satellite Projection. Built on top of energy.gov's jekyll platform (loosely). It should work in browser and in the future you should be able to print (to the clipboard) the parameters you have selected.

A work in progress. Please feel free to contribute/fork. It is public domain, as a result of it being part of my work with the [Energy Department](https://github.com/energyapps)

## Wish/To-do List
- Points?
- Smaller shape dataset
- add buttons for presets views (china globe, china, pole, northeast, etc)
- don't redraw but just select (improve d3 selection)
- add links to relevant details
- on enter, fire the reload
- add graticule changing options
- add color changing options
- add option to print (onto the clipboard?) your results
- update readme
